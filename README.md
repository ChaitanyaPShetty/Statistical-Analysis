# USA Accident Severity Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting accident severity trends in the USA using Machine Learning and statistical techniques. By developing a comprehensive pipeline, we aim to identify key factors that influence accident severity and geographic risk zones.

## Key Objectives

* Design a Machine Learning pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
* Assess accident severity trends across the USA.
* Identify key factors influencing accident severity.
* Determine geographic risk zones.
* Apply statistical hypothesis testing and time series forecasting.
* Build regression models to predict accident severity.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Utilized Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data cleaning and preprocessing.
    * Handled missing values and outliers.
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance.
3.  **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:**
    * Conducted ANOVA, T-Tests, and Chi-Square tests to identify statistically significant factors.
4.  **Time Series Forecasting:**
    * Applied ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast accident severity trends over time.
5.  **Regression Modeling:**
    * Built Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models to predict accident severity.
6.  **Geographic Risk Zone Identification:**
    * Analyzed geographic data to identify areas with high accident severity.
7.  **Machine Learning Pipeline:**
    * Designed a complete Machine Learning pipeline for efficient data processing and modeling.
